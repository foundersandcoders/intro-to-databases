# Intro to Databases

This repo is designed as a guideline for mentors so they can explain databases to begginner developers who are not familiar with the concept.

## What's a database, why use it in an application and when is it useful?

### When and why to use a database?

- Apps that we use in real life, save data, for example if an app has users then it'll save their login details.
- This data has to be saved somewhere, a "data centre" where we save new data, fetch it or edit it.
- This "data centre" is called a database.
- You can simplify this concept by saying that a database is a chunk of memory dedicated for the app's data.

### In which applications is it useful to have a database?

- Ask the students this question to see if they have understood.
- Then ask which applications would not need a database.

### Example for a database

- The example would be about users and posts (a small facebook).
- You can start by explaining that the app has users where each user has a username and a password, whereas each post has a user reference and a post id.
- Before writing this on the board, ask the students how they expect each data would be represented, as in which data does a user have and what does a post have, don't mention the concept of tables yet.

## How to structure a database and how to separate it into tables?

## What is a schema and how to make one?

## Basic commands for selecting and inserting.
